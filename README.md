# Nebulis Coding Analytics Platform &middot; ![TravisCI Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-server.svg) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-server/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-server?branch=master) [![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-server/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-server)

Nebulis provides realtime analytics and reporting for coding projects. With Nebulis you can embed an endpoint into your coding units so that you can gather code changes to a project fork. Nebulis is set up to be close to zero configuration, so as soon as the endpoint is launched on a fork, that user will be instantly registered into the system and attached to the associated project.
